            <h2>Prerequisite Course / Knowledge</h2>
            <p>
                Elementary knowledge of Calculus. Much of mathematics relies on our ability to be able to solve
                equations, if not in explicit exact forms, then at least in being able to establish the existence of
                solutions. To do this requires a knowledge of so-called "analysis", which in many respects is just
                Calculus in very general settings. The foundations for this work are commenced in Real Analysis, a
                course that develops this basic material in a systematic and rigorous manner in the context of real-valued functions of a real variable.
