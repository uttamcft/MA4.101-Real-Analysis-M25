        <h3>Prerequisite Course/Knowledge:</h3>
        Elementary knowledge of Calculus Much of mathematics relies on our ability to be able to solve 
        equations, if not in explicit exact forms, then at least in being able to establish the existence of 
        solutions. To do this requires a knowledge of so-called "analysis", which in many respects is just 
        Calculus in very general settings. The foundations for this work are commenced in Real Analysis, a 
        course that develops this basic material in a systematic and rigorous manner in the context of realvalued
        functions of a real variable.
